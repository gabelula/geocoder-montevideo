Geocoder Montevideo
-------------------

This web app provides a very simple geocoder on top of CloudMade's API
specifically aimed at Montevideo, Uruguay.

Dependencies
============

This is built with [Cuba](http://github.com/soveran/cuba), so install that:

    gem install cuba

You need to have a CloudMade API key in order to run this. Sign up for free at
http://cloudmade.com in order to get a key.

Running
=======

To run, once you install `cuba`, do this:

    API_KEY="<your cloudmade key>" rackup

That should be all you need.

Credits
=======

Huge thanks go to [Cubox](http://cuboxsa.com) for letting me work on this
project, and to [CloudMade](http://cloudmade.com) for their awesome API and
service.
